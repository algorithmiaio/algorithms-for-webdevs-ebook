# Conclusion

While we couldn't cover all of our favorite algorithms, we hope you've found the explanations of some common algorithms in this book helpful. We believe that web developers of all kinds, from the formally trained to the self-taught, can benefit greatly from the use of algorithms in their websites and web applications. With Algorithmia, we try to let the power of algorithms work for you through a simple API so that you can harness their power without investing time & energy learning to write the complicated algorithms yourself. Now you can make MVPs, iterate on your products, and leverage complex computations quicker than ever.

## What's next?

We'd love to hear from you! If you've found this book useful, please head on over to [Algorithmia](http://algorithmia.com) and check out some of the other algorithms we offer. You can also find more examples of Algorithmia algorithms at work on our [blog](http://blog.algorithmia.com/).

If you've built something using the Algorithmia API, [drop us a line](mailto:info@algorithmia.com) and let us know! We'd love to feature your work on our blog. 

Find a bug in the code? Can't get the examples working? Submit an issue on the book's [repository](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/algorithms-for-webdevs-ebook) and we'll help you get things up and running correctly.
